# threat-detection-pipeline
✨ A compilation of valuable resources and example data pipelines that aim to help design effective threat detection pipelines. 👷 🏗 

> I want to emphasize that although I am not an expert in Data Engineering, my goal is to gather and organize useful information from public blog posts, conference talks, and contributions from data engineering experts and companies. This is done with the purpose of creating a reference hub for designing detection pipelines. Join us, explore the curated content, and contribute to this collaborative effort.
